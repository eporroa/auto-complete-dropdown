# Autocomplete Dropdown Component

This is a basic implementation of an autocomplete component in React with TypeScript.

## Running the project

1. Install all the dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Run the project with `npm run dev`
3. _FOR BONUS 1_ If you want to test with an remote source to pull the names, switch to branch `external-source` by running: `git checkout external-source`

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
